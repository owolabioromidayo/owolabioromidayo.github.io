<br/>
   A federated queueing platform for GPU processing in AI photo editing applications written using Python, React.js, and Websockets. Implemented a GPU Client that runs txt/img2img, inpainting, outpainting, upscaling and removal operations. Wrote a queueing server that connects GPU clients via WebSockets and handles task scheduling. Wrote a frontend photo editing application using React.js which has a generalization layer to support models. Wrote a server-server protocol for federation and trust-based priority scheduling for bad actor management. Conducted simulations to profile the trust-based scheduling system on multiple federated queue servers.
