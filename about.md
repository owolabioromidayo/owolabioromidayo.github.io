## Projects


### YugoDB


   Developing a weird mixture of OLAP/OLTP database management system in Rust, combining features from document-oriented and relational databases, to be stored in column or row-oriented order. <br>
   Implemented a B+ tree index and a multi-file pager for the database storage engine. <br>
   Creating a custom language interpreter to support both document-oriented and relational queries and joins, which generates an AST that can be optimised over. <Br> Working on type checking the interpreter, an execution model, and a database abstraction model currently.

<br/>
   A federated queueing platform for GPU processing in AI photo editing applications written using Python, React.js, and Websockets. <br >
   Implemented a GPU Client that runs txt/img2img, inpainting, outpainting, upscaling and removal operations. Wrote a queueing server that connects GPU clients via WebSockets and handles task scheduling. <Br>
   Wrote a frontend photo editing application using React.js which has a generalization layer to support models. <br> 
   Wrote a server-server protocol for federation and trust-based priority scheduling for bad actor management. <br> 
   Conducted simulations to profile the trust-based scheduling system on multiple federated queue servers.

<br/>
A Solar Weather Information Station written with FreeRTOS, C, Python, React.js, and Typescript. <br>
 Deployed a Self-Retraining Weather Prediction Service on AWS Lambda. <br>
  Backend service written with Python, Flask and Heroku and dashboard with React.js. <br> 
  Wrote ESP32 firmware code for sensor interfacing, power management and configurable WiFi. <br> 
  Ported I2C Driver for the Si1145 sensor from C++ to C and wrote driver code for the GUVA-S12SD sensor. <br>
