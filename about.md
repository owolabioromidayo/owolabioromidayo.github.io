# Hello there!

My name is Dayo. I am a 20 y/o recent grad of Computer Engineering. Highly interested in Software Engineering, Embedded Systems, ML, Hardware and Applied Maths. I am a very obsessive and persistent learner and enjoy diving down layers of abstraction and complexity. I want to build software that elevates human consciousness and capabilities.

<br/>
   A federated queueing platform for GPU processing in AI photo editing applications written using Python, React.js, and Websockets. Implemented a GPU Client that runs txt/img2img, inpainting, outpainting, upscaling and removal operations. Wrote a queueing server that connects GPU clients via WebSockets and handles task scheduling. Wrote a frontend photo editing application using React.js which has a generalization layer to support models. Wrote a server-server protocol for federation and trust-based priority scheduling for bad actor management. Conducted simulations to profile the trust-based scheduling system on multiple federated queue servers.
