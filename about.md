## Projects


### YugoDB

   Developing a polymorphic database storage engine from scratch in Rust. <br>
   Implemented a generic B+ tree index, a concurrent multi-file disk pager with a caching system. <br>
   Wrote abstractions to support document-oriented, relational, row, and column databases, tables, pages, and records. <br>
   Created a custom query language and interpreter, to support queries and joins across all storage types. <br>
   Uses a dynamic set of closures as a vector materialization model, with support for predicate pushdown. <br>
   Custom ser/deser methods for relational records.

<br/>
   A federated queueing platform for GPU processing in AI photo editing applications written using Python, React.js, and Websockets. <br >
   Implemented a GPU Client that runs txt/img2img, inpainting, outpainting, upscaling and removal operations. <br> 
   Wrote a queueing server that connects GPU clients via WebSockets and handles task scheduling. <Br>
   Wrote a frontend photo editing application using React.js which has a generalization layer to support models. <br> 
   Wrote a server-server protocol for federation and trust-based priority scheduling for bad actor management. <br> 
   Conducted simulations to profile the trust-based scheduling system on multiple federated queue servers. <br>
